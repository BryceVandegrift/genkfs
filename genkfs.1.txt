Name
----
genkfs - Writes KFS filesystems into ROM dumps

Synopsis
--------
'genkfs' _input_ _model_

Description
-----------

_input_ is the ROM file you would like to write the filesystem to. _model_ is a
path to a directory that will be copied into / on the new filesystem.

Symbolic Links
--------------

Symbolic links are supported but have special constraints. Instead of making
symlinks that make sense in the context of your model filesystem, make symlinks
that make sense in the context of the final filesystem. That is, if you want the
resulting filesystem to have a symlink from /var/link to /var/target, you should
make a link in your model that points to /var/target, **even if your local
filesystem does not have anything interesting at /var/target**.

In other words, to make the final filesystem have that link from /var/link to
/var/target, run this command on _model/_:

	ln -s /var/target model/var/link

Examples
--------

genkfs input.rom ./temp::
	Creates a KFS filesystem in input.rom and copies the contents of ./temp to the
	root of the new filesystem.
